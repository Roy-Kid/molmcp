# .claude/notes/ — passive project knowledge

Internal agent context that outlives any single feature. Not public
documentation (that lives in `docs/`), not active work items (those live
in `.claude/specs/`).

- `notes.md` — evolving decisions, captured by `/mol:note`
- `architecture.md` — project blueprint; populated by `/mol:map`,
  consumed by the `librarian` agent during `/mol:spec`
- `open-questions.md` — uncertainties recorded during bootstrap or
  later; resolve and prune over time
- `harness-contract.md` — the two long-lived harness rules: `MolCrafts/harness`
  is a new empty repository (not `molcrafts-harness` renamed), and identity is
  a Git SHA
